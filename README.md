A Script Providing General Review of Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) Downloads of the **copBasic** and **lmomco** packages in the _R_ language. It is uncertain how much interest might exist regarding this script. The script was written mostly to satisfy an obviously professional curiosity in the relative downloads of **copBasic** and **lmomco** relative to general `global` activity as measured by the _RStudio_ daily archive of packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

The processing time is quite large if run from scratch because a `.gz` zipped comma-separated (CSV) formatted file is downloaded or for day requested. The daily archive is not much deeper than January 1, 2013. As a result, the script starts (could) there. However, provision is made through the use of RData binary file holding a previous cache of a large data frame is made. In operation, the author commonly waits about a month before saving the `AP` object to the local file system and then updating some requested dates in `start` and `today` variables and the `load()` call in the script. Lastly, periodic updates to three text files are made for the release dates of **copBasic**, **lmomco**, and _R_ itself.
